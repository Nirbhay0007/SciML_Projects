    "### 1. The \"Forward Pass\" ‚û°Ô∏è: (Prediction & Simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the model makes its *first guess*. It flows in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input:** Start with the *current* known tumor size, $T$. (At the very beginning, this is the initial size $T_0$).\n",
    "2.  **NN Prediction:** You feed this $T$ into the two neural networks (NNs) *simultaneously*:\n",
    "    * `NN1` (with its current random \"knobs\") predicts a value for the growth rate $r$.\n",
    "    * `NN2` (with *its* current random \"knobs\") predicts a value for the carrying capacity $K$.\n",
    "3.  **Build the Equation:** These predicted values, $r_{pred}$ and $K_{pred}$, are plugged into the Gompertz equation. Now you have a *complete* equation with *specific numbers*:\n",

    "    \\frac{dT}{dt} = r_{pred} \\cdot T \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{pred}}{T}\\right) - c(t)T\n",

    "    * It starts at $T_0$.\n",
    "    * It uses the equation to find the speed.\n",
    "    * It takes a tiny step forward in time (e.g., 0.1 days) to predict the new size, $T_1$.\n",
    "    * It repeats this process (using $T_1$ to find the speed for $T_2$, etc.) until it has generated a **full predicted tumor size curve** ($T_{predicted}$) over all 50 days.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the \"learning\" part. The model compares its *guess* to the *reality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Loss:** The model now compares its predicted curve ($T_{predicted}$) with the **actual data** ($T_{true}$). It uses a **Loss Function** (e.g., Mean Squared Error) to get a single number for how \"wrong\" it was.\n",
    "    * **Formula:** $\\text{Loss} = \\text{Average of } (T_{predicted} - T_{true})^2 \\text{ for all time points}$.\n",

    "    * It calculates *how much* each individual \"knob\" (weight and bias) *inside* `NN1` and `NN2` contributed to that final error.\n",
    "    * It then **\"nudges\" all the knobs** in the direction that would have made the error smaller.\n",

    "    * ...\n",
    "    * **Loop 50:** After many iterations, the NNs have \"learned\" to predict the *true* underlying $r$ and $K$ values. The predicted curve ($T_{predicted}$) will now almost perfectly overlap with the real data ($T_{true}$), and the `Loss` will be very close to zero.\n",
