    "Here is the detailed workflow with commands for working on your project from either your lab system or your laptop:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Setup (One-time per machine)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is only needed the *very first time* you set up the project on a new computer (e.g., when you first get your laptop and want to start working on the project there).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Clone the repository:**\n",
    "    *   Open your terminal.\n",
    "    *   Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., `cd C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Documents\\GitHub_Projects`).\n",
    "    *   Run the clone command:\n",
    "        ````sh\n",
    "        git clone https://github.com/Nirbhay0007/SciML_Projects.git\n",
    "        ````\n",
    "    *   This creates a local copy of your project.\n",
    "    *   Then, navigate into the newly created project directory:\n",
    "        ````sh\n",
    "        cd SciML_Projects\n",
    "        ````\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Daily Workflow (Each time you start or finish working)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the cycle you'll follow every time you sit down to work on the project, regardless of whether it's your lab system or your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Before you start making changes (on any machine):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Pull the latest changes:** Always start by pulling any updates that might have been pushed from the other machine. This ensures your local copy is up-to-date.\n",
    "    ````sh\n",
    "    git pull origin main\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "    *   *Explanation:* This command fetches changes from the `main` branch of your `origin` (GitHub) remote and merges them into your current local branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. While you are working and making changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Edit your files:** Open your project in VS Code and make your desired modifications (e.g., edit cancer_growth_modeling.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. When you are done working for a session (on any machine):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Check the status of your changes:**\n",
    "    ````sh\n",
    "    git status\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "    *   *Explanation:* This shows you which files have been modified, added, or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Stage your changes:** Add all modified/new files to the staging area.\n",
    "    ````sh\n",
    "    git add .\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "    *   *Explanation:* The `.` stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. You can also stage specific files (e.g., `git add cancer_growth_modeling.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Commit your changes:** Save your staged changes to your local repository with a descriptive message.\n",
    "    ````sh\n",
    "    git commit -m \"A clear and concise message describing your changes\"\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "    *   *Explanation:* Good commit messages help you and others understand the history of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Push your changes to GitHub:** Upload your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "    ````sh\n",
    "    git push origin main\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "    *   *Explanation:* This sends your committed changes from your local `main` branch to the `main` branch on `origin` (GitHub). You might be prompted for your GitHub credentials or a Personal Access Token.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of the core loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `git pull origin main` (to get latest)\n",
    "2.  Work on files\n",
    "3.  `git add .` (to stage changes)\n",
    "4.  `git commit -m \"Your message\"` (to save locally)\n",
    "5.  `git push origin main` (to upload to GitHub)\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this routine, you'll keep your project synchronized across all your machines."
